# Raw Data Munging

## Overview
In this training exercise, I will try to make usable a real data source: **NASA's historic measurements of the Earth's surface temperatures**.  In order to do analysis of this data, some preparation work is necessary.  In particular, I will:
1. Download raw data.
1. Write a Python program to clean up (i.e. munge) the data and save it into a standard Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format text file.
1. Write a second Python program to do some simple analysis of the data in the CSV file.
